# Campfire--Embers-of-the-Night-
# Maham Butt- October 1,2024 

Underneath the starry skies,
Whispers of the wild draw nigh
We gather around with whispered sighs,
Crackling flames, the warmth so bright 
Telling stories,hearts take flight 

In the glow of the campfire light, 
We find our dreams in the still of the night 
With every laugh, with every song 
Together is where we all belong.

Marshmallowes roasting sweet delight, 
Old friends laughing, everything feels right,
Shadows dancing the fire's glow,
Memories made that we'll always know 

In the glow of the campfire light, 
We find our dreams in the still of the night 
With every laugh, with every song 
Together is where we all belong.

The breeze whispers secrets to the trees, 
And carries our voices on a gentle breeze,
Beneath the stars. our spirits rise, 
Bound by the fire, under endless skies/

So here's to the night that never grows old,
To the bonds we build, with stories of friendship forever told,
In the warmth of the fire, we find our way,
Embers of the night, forever stay.

As the fire fades, the echoes remain, 
Of laughter, love, and joy unchained, 
Through the night, until the dawn's first light, 
We'll carry this warmth, in our hearts so bright
